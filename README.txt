1.bookstore

My application shows the architecture of a java application system organized using the 
client–server pattern.

In a client–server architecture, the functionality of the system is organized into services,
with each service delivered from a separate server. Clients are users of these services and
access servers to make use of them.

The application (BookStore) is a java application which stores books on a database and the client
can only access the database after being authorized(after login to the system). The client can add 
books and view the books list on the system.

 My application shows the architecture of a java application system organized using the
MVC pattern.The system is structured into three logical components that interact with each other. 
The Model component,view component and controll component.

It accepts inputs(name,bachelors/masters,number of courses) from the user and calculates the 
amount based on the given data the displays the output.
